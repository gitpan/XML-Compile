	- Perl internal integer dependent size of INT_MIN and INT_MAX
	  to avoid use of BigInt.  Idea by [Merijn H Brand]

	- Added type assertions to translator, to check known attributes
	  to follow the spec.

	- All constructing routines are called with ($path, $args, ...)
	  where before, the $args option had different locations in the
	  parameter lists.

	- Moved element fixed tests to t/47fixed.t, reimplemented it to
	  make it work with BigInt.

	- Implemented element default and t/48default.t

	- Non-sloppy integers implemented in BigInts, tests t/49big.t

	- Element ref() should not specify own name.

	- XML::Compile::Schema::Instance collects info about one single
	  schema.
