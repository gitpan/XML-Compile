Mark Overmeer.

version 0.09: Mon Sep 25 08:40:24 CEST 2006

	Fixes:  [thanks to cpan-testers work by Slavan Rezic]

	- MANIFEST not correct: contained old files

	- Removed dependency for Regex::Common, added Math::BigInt

	- Upgraded to XML::LibXML 1.60, which changed from Attribute
	  handling.

version 0.08: Fri Sep 22 15:52:49 CEST 2006

	- Turned XML::Compile::Schema::Translate into a singleton object,
	  and reshaped functions into methods.  The arguments hash intern
	  in object.  Together much cleaner.

	- Replaced use of "croak" for errors during translation into a
	  call to the error() method, with nicer and more consequent
	  error text layout.

	- Split XML::Compile::Schema::BuiltinStructs into lazy loading
	  XML::Compile::Schema::XmlReader and ::XmlWriter.

version 0.07: Thu Sep 21 15:06:05 CEST 2006

	- implemented substitution-groups

	- implementation of ref-element was bogus.

	- improved documentation (more about Schemas)

	- $schema->addSchemas from text

	- $schema->importSchema() with support of search-path.  Schema's not
	  automatically installed (yet)

	- added other schema's to the distribution.

version 0.06: Thu Sep 14 10:10:31 CEST 2006

	- The internals of the translator (and the produced code) are
	  fully rewritted to support complexType/simpleContent in a
	  clean way.

	- better support for list.

	- major improvements in the documentation.

version 0.05: Sun Aug 27 12:00:00 CEST 2006

	- Release as OODoc processed package :(

version 0.04: Sun Aug 27 11:49:54 CEST 2006

	- Rewrote the particle handling to better process nesting and
	  min/maxOccurs.

	- Many rewrites to implement complexType/simpleType processing.

	- Extended list describing missing features (and resolved quite
	  a few of them).  Parser is much stricter now, closer to the
	  specs.

version 0.03: Tue Aug 15 09:13:06 CEST 2006

	- Doc about what to pass as type to compile() was not updated.

	- Added attribute default, fixed and use=forbidden.

	- Added simpleType within list.

	- Added memberTypes with union.

version 0.02: Mon Aug 14 13:42:02 CEST 2006

	- Perl internal integer dependent size of INT_MIN and INT_MAX
	  to avoid use of BigInt.  Idea by [Merijn H Brand]

	- Added type assertions to translator, to check known attributes
	  to follow the spec.

	- All constructing routines are called with ($path, $args, ...)
	  where before, the $args option had different locations in the
	  parameter lists.

	- Moved element fixed tests to t/47fixed.t, reimplemented it to
	  make it work with BigInt.

	- Implemented element default and t/48default.t

	- Non-sloppy integers implemented in BigInts, tests t/49big.t

	- Element ref() should not specify own name.

	- XML::Compile::Schema::Instance collects info about one single
	  schema.

	- XML::Compile::Schema::Namespaces collects schema instances.

	- Under fly adding of schemas with ::Schema::addSchema

	- understands qualified and unqualified processing

	- and many more...

version 0.01: Wed Jul 26 12:19:10 CEST 2006

	- initial version
