==== XML::Compile README.todo

= initial prefix problem:

An implementational problem: when a prefix is chosen, it is not decided
by the XML::LibXML library, but by XML::Compile.  An xyz:tag is chosen,
and xmlns:xyz is added later.  The causes the problem that the node's
localname will be "xyz:tag" until the node is stringified... which
is incorrect.

= tests
 - Missing: test <all> and <choice> in various combinations with
   blocks, <any> and substitutionGroups.  Many examples in practice
   seem to show that it works as it should.
 - the implementation of most basic types should have regression tests,

= known limitations
 - nillable support for mixed elements
 - typemaps on basic types
 - errors on types should show dynamic nested location in structure,
   not path in schema.

= wishlist
 - handle XML::LibXML::Error objects
 - useSchema() relation to ::Cache::declare()?
 - proposed new schema features:
     . alternative
       http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/x-xml11pt2/#N103D7
     . ::Instance cannot handle element and attribute declaration attribute
       "targetNamespace" (proposed schema feature)
 - namespace blocking option for templates; exclude deprecated elements
 - when you use appendChild i.s.o. addChild, the namespace declarators
   are managed automatically correct, saving a wrapper in the writer
   and avoiding the prefix trick. [Roman Daniel].  Nicer, but would
   affect the whole code and most tests.
