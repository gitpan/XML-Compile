XML::Compile::SOAP::Operation - defines a possible SOAP interaction

=head2 Constructors

$obj-E<gt>B<new>(OPTIONS)

=over 4

The OPTIONS are all collected from the WSDL description by
L<XML::Compile::WSDL::operation()|XML::Compile::WSDL/"Extension">.  End-users should not attempt to
initiate this object directly.

 Option       --Default
 bindOperation  undef
 binding        <required>
 port           <required>
 portOperation  <required>
 portType       <required>
 protocol       'HTTP'
 schemas        <required>
 service        <required>
 soapStyle      'document'

. protocol => URI|'HTTP'

=over 4

C<HTTP> is short for C<http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/http>, which
is a constant to indicate that transport should use the HyperText
Transfer Protocol.

=head2 Use

$obj-E<gt>B<action>

=over 4

Returns the C<soapAction> and C<style> attributes, when available.

=back

$obj-E<gt>B<canTransport>(PROTOCOL, STYLE)

=over 4

Returns a true value when the pair with URI of the PROTOCOL and
processing style (either C<document> (default) or C<rpc>) is
provided as soap binding.

=back

$obj-E<gt>B<endPointAddresses>

=over 4

Returns the list of alternative URLs for the end-point, which should
be defined within the service's port declaration.

=back

$obj-E<gt>B<kind>

=over 4

This returns the type of operation this is.  There are four kinds, which
are returned as strings C<one-way>, C<request-response>, C<sollicit-response>,
and C<notification>.  The latter two are initiated by a server, the former
two by a client.

=back

$obj-E<gt>B<prepare>(OPTIONS)

=over 4

Returns one CODE reference which handles the processing for this
operation.

You pass that CODE reference an input message of the correct
type, as pure Perl HASH structure.  An 'request-response' operation
will return then answer, or C<undef> in case of failure.  An 'one-way'
operation with return C<undef> in case of failure, and a true value
when successfull.

 Option   --Default
 protocol   new(protocol)
 role       'CLIENT'
 soapStyle  new(soapStyle)

. protocol => URI|'HTTP'

. role => 'CLIENT'|'SERVER'

=over 4

Of course, when you interact between two systems, then you need to
define whether you are the sender or receiver of the data.
