=head1 NAME

XML::Compile::Schema::Template - bricks to create an XML or PERL example



=head1 SYNOPSIS

 my $schema = XML::Compile::Schema->new(...);
 print $schema->template(XML  => $type, ...);
 print $schema->template(PERL => $type, ...);


=head1 DESCRIPTION

The translator understands schema's, but does not encode that into
actions.  This module interprets the parse results of the translator,
and creates a kind of abstract syntax tree from it, which can be used
for documentational purposes.  Then, it implements to ways to represent
that knowledge: as an XML or a Perl example of the data-structure which
the schema describes.
