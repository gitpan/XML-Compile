=head1 DESCRIPTION

The translator understands schemas, but does not encode that into
actions.  This module interprets the parse results of the translator,
and creates a kind of abstract syntax tree from it, which can be used
for documentational purposes.  Then, it implements to ways to represent
that knowledge: as an XML or a Perl example of the data-structure which
the schema describes.
