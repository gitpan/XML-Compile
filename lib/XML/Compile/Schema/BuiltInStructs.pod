=head1 NAME

XML::Compile::Schema::BuiltInStructs - handling of built-in data-structures


=head1 INHERITANCE

 XML::Compile::Schema::BuiltInStructs
   is an Exporter


=head1 SYNOPSIS

 # Not for end-users
 use XML::Compile::Schema::BuiltInStructs;
 my $run = builtin_structs('READER');


=head1 DESCRIPTION

The translator understands schema's, but does not encode that into
actions.  This module implements those actions, which are different
for the reader and the writer.

In a later release, this module will probably be split in a separate
READER and WRITER module, because we usually do not need both reader
and writer within one program.



=head1 METHODS


XML::Compile::Schema::BuiltInStructs-E<gt>B<builtin_structs>('READER'|'WRITER')

=over 4

Returns a hash which defines the code to produce the code which
will do the job... code which produces code... I know, it is not
that simple.
