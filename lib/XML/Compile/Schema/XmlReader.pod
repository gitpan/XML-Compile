XML::Compile::Schema::XmlReader - bricks to translate XML to HASH



=head1 SYNOPSIS

 my $schema = XML::Compile::Schema->new(...);
 my $code   = $schema->compile(READER => ...);


=head1 DESCRIPTION

The translator understands schema's, but does not encode that into
actions.  This module implements those actions to translate from XML
into a (nested) Perl HASH structure.
