=head1 NAME

XML::Compile::Schema::Specs - Predefined Schema Information

=head1 INHERITANCE

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 # not for end-users
 use XML::Compile::Schema::Specs;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package defines the various schema-specifications, however
currently only supports the last one: L<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema>.
It is simple to extend the list of supported schemas, but someone has
to do it.  Feel invited.

=head1 METHODS

XML::Compile::Schema::Specs-E<gt>B<builtInType>(EXPANDED | (URI,LOCAL), OPTIONS)

=over 4

Provide an EXPANDED (full) type name or an namespace URI and a LOCAL node
name.  Returned is a HASH with process information or C<undef> if not
found.

 Option         --Default
 sloppy_integers  <false>

. sloppy_integers => BOOLEAN

=over 4

the <decimal> and <integer> types must accept huge integers, which
require C<Math::Big*> objects to process.  But often, Perl's normal
signed 32bit integers suffice... which is good for performance, but not
standard compliant.

=back

=back

XML::Compile::Schema::Specs-E<gt>B<predefinedSchema>(URI)

=over 4

Return a HASH which contains the schema information for the specified
URI (or undef if it doesn't exist).

=back

XML::Compile::Schema::Specs-E<gt>B<predefinedSchemas>

=over 4

Returns the uri of all predefined schemas.
